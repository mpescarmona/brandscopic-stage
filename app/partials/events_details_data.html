		<p>The bar semed to be a little more low key by the time that we got there, but there were enough people that were interested in trying what we had. The managed said that it had been relly busy earlier bc of a Jazzz Festival that was going on. We decideded it may have been too crowded had we come then. The manager also filled us in on a large group of regulars that were whiskey drinkers, so thet were very excited to have a sample of Jameson, event that wasn’t their normal flavor. Its is an Irish Pub type bar, so we fit in really well and everyone loved that we had an usual way to try a shot. We ran into a few people that were a bit older and reserved and didn’t want to use the shot ski or take pictures because they were teachers and didn’t want anyone to see them drinking. Since there was a smaller amount of consumers in there at the time, we really took over the bar and were the center of attention for about the entire time we were there. Everyone really liked the Jameson complimented us on having such a good product to sample. </p>
